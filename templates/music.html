    <p class="mb-4" style="color: #ccd6f6; line-height: 1.6; position: relative; z-index: 10;">
        My journey with music began during my school days when I was introduced to Turkish songs, which sparked my interest in diverse musical styles, eventually leading me to explore English and Japanese songs as well. In 2024, I discovered the beautiful world of Carnatic music, which has become a significant and enriching part of my life.

                <h3>Mridangam</h3>
                <p>
                    I haven't yet begun formal training in Mridangam, but I'm eagerly waiting for the right time and guru to start my journey. The rhythmic patterns and techniques of Mridangam have always fascinated me.

                <h3>Harmonium</h3>
                <p>
                    I recently began learning Carnatic harmonium about two months ago. The rich, melodic tones of this instrument have been captivating, and I'm enjoying exploring how it complements the intricate melodic structures of Carnatic music.

                <h3>Yakshagana</h3>
                <p>
                    I've had the opportunity to learn the basics of Yakshagana in the "Tenku-Tittu" style for about 2-3 months. While I've gained foundational knowledge of this traditional theater form from Karnataka, I plan to take formal classes to deepen my understanding and skills in this expressive art that uniquely combines music, dance, and storytelling.
